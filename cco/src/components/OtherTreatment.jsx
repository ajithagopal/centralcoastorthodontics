        That’s why we offer specialized treatment for Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMD), a group of conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) — the hinge connecting your jaw to your skull. Among the most common, irritating, and difficult-to-diagnose problems with head and neck pain are temporal mandibular joint problems, more commonly known as TMJ problems.

        Now that we’ve implanted that thought into your head, try to brush it aside and make room for modern-day orthodontic surgery. While not necessary for most people, today’s surgical orthodontics is carefully planned and is a collaborative approach from your orthodontist and an oral surgeon.

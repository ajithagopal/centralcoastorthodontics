        That’s why we offer specialized treatment for Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMD), a group of conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) — the hinge connecting your jaw to your skull. Among the most common, irritating, and difficult-to-diagnose problems with head and neck pain are temporal mandibular joint problems, more commonly known as TMJ problems.

    <p className='text-gray-500 font-bold text-3xl'>Sleep Apnea</p>
    <p className='py-2 text-base'>Wearing a mouthguard can be an effective treatment option for a specific type of sleep apnea called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open during sleep, leading to repeated pauses in breathing and disrupted sleep patterns. A mouthguard used to treat sleep apnea is called a mandibular advancement device (MAD) or a mandibular repositioning device (MRD).</p>

    <p className='py-2 text-base'>Do you grind your teeth at night? Do you wake up with a sore or stiff jaw after a night’s sleep? If so, a mouthguard might be something to consider. Mouth guards provide protection from teeth grinding in a number of ways.</p>
